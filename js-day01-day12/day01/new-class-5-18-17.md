// This is from Matt's new JS class. I'm currently in Angular 2 but saw this in Slack

Some thoughts for JavaScript 1. I am and will always be an advocate for learning through as many different channels as possible. Everyone absorbs information differently. Some work best visually, others audibly and others through actually doing it. My goal is to attempt to hit all of those marks in class. However, 6 weeks is not a lot and information moves quickly in class. Utilizing additional educational options such as Lynda.com and Javascript30 will provide alternative explanations to many of the concepts we will learn in class. Often times, the explanation is the same, it just takes a dozen times of hearing it for the lightbulb to illuminate. I promise though, you will have many “a-ha” moments in the class. These moments however will generally only occur when you put all of your attention to it. The first days are dry, and I totally get that. Trying to make writing an `alert()` a half dozen times fun isn’t easy. But do it. Follow along. The hard stuff is coming, I swear. :nerd_face:

As for the resources I posted: Javascript30.com will drop you right into a bunch of stuff you won’t understand. But what’s the best way to learn to swim? Get pushed into the deep end. Sure, there’s the chance you can drown, but fortunately, there’s no water in JavaScript. :slightly_smiling_face:

Also, I linked to Lynda.com. Now the main URL will not give you access to the login via your library card and pin. The URL for that is: https://www.lynda.com/portal/sip?org=fresnolibrary.org

Study hard, dive in and ask questions. I won’t be able to answer them all, but I’ll do my darndest. :metal:
