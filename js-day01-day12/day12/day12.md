JS Code Answer For 'Netflix' Final Project

Hey everyone!! To all the students who attended my *last* round of JavaScript… I want to see how you did! I don’t however want to just post the answers here for all to see on Slack because that won’t be fair to the students who are in my current round. Here’s what I want: DM me (@migs) with a link to your Github repository. Once I have that direct message, I’ll reply with the completed JS work. I look forward to seeing all of your projects. It was a crazy 6 weeks and I know it wasn’t nearly enough. But stay focused, keep coding and press into the frustration. It gets easier I swear!!
