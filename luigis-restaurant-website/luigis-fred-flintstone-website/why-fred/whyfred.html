        <span class="whyfred2">Actually the name originally came from a customer. <br>
        It all started in the early fifties when a customer <br>
        of ours said that our Italian Steak Sandwich was big <br>
        enough for Fred Flintstone to eat. We thought this <br>
        was pretty remarkable since the character of Fred <br>
        Flintstone hadn't even been invented yet. Over the <br>
        years the name "Fred" caught on and to this day our <br>
        customers still come in and say, "Gimme a Fred".</span></b>
