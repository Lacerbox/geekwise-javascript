<a><p id="loucook-paragraph"><span class="loucook2">
The Meatball Sandwich is a very complicated sandwich.
You start off with some really good French bread.
You want a good 12-inch loaf. You take the loaf
and slice it in half long ways. Next you spread some
really good homemade meat sauce on the bottom half.
Now it's time for the meatballs. By the way if you
don't know how to make good homemade meatballs don't
bother trying this recipe. Now take the meatballs and
just sort of throw them on the bottom half of the bread.
Next you throw some Mozzarella on top of the meatballs,
sprinkle a little Parmesan cheese and toss it in the oven.
After a couple of minutes when the cheese gets all gooey
you know it's time to eat. Take the sandwich out of the
oven, throw a little more meat sauce on the top half of
the bread, slap it together and bon appetite! Best when
served with a fine chilled Chianti, or a beer.</span></p></a>
