    <h5>Where Is Luigi's?</h5>

<a><p id="loucook-paragraph"><span class="loucook2">
This page is to let you know a little about Luigi's.
Luigi's was a family run restaurant in Fresno, California
from 1944 to 1993.  It was founded by my grandfather Luigi
Cerbo in 1944 and served Italian food for 49 years. Luigi was
born in Pietramelara, Italy. The reason I created this website was
for a class project in college. The reason I used the restaurant
theme was because I spent most of my life in the restaurant
business. I keep it up for fun and make it up as I go along.
Enough about Luigi's.</span></p></a>

    <h5>Who Is Luigi?</h5>

<a><p id="loucook-paragraph"><span class="loucook2">
Like my grandfather my name is Louis Cerbo (Louis in Italian is Luigi).
After getting out of the restaurant business I moved from Fresno to The San
Francisco Bay Area where I did the whole Bachelors/Masters degree thing in
Computer Science. Now I'm back in Fresno. I guess this Restaurant stuff will
always be in my blood. Enough about me.</span></p></a><br>

<!-- <H5>Like my grandfather my name is Louis Cerbo (Louis in Italian is Luigi).
I live with my wife Cathrine in Fresno, California. She has two sons, Jon and
Josh and a daughter, Julia. I have two daughters, Ashley and Frankie, and a son,
Joey. They range in age from 19 (Jon) to 4 (Joey). When we have all 6 kids at
once we're like a dysfunctional 'Brady Bunch'. After getting out of the restaurant
business I moved from Fresno to the Bay Area where I did the whole Bachelors/Masters
degree thing in Computer Science. Now I'm back in Fresno. I guess the Restaurant
stuff will always be in my blood. Enough about me.<BR><BR><BR></H5> -->
